go build -o leakfinder leakfinder.go
./leakfinder help
```

### Prerequisites

- **Go application** with pprof enabled:
  ```go
  import _ "net/http/pprof"
  go func() {
      log.Println(http.ListenAndServe("localhost:6060", nil))
  }()
  ```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Shell Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Quick health check (both goroutines and memory)
./leakfinder.sh check

# Focus on specific aspects
./leakfinder.sh check -goroutines-only     # Only goroutines
./leakfinder.sh check -memory-only         # Only memory

# Real-time monitoring with custom duration
./leakfinder.sh -monitor-duration=10m monitor
./leakfinder.sh -monitor-duration=5m monitor -goroutines-only

# Detailed analysis with verbose output
./leakfinder.sh -verbose analyze
./leakfinder.sh analyze -memory-only       # Memory-focused analysis

# Before/after comparison
./leakfinder.sh compare
./leakfinder.sh compare -goroutines-only   # Compare only goroutines

# Advanced leak detection algorithms
./leakfinder.sh patterns                   # Stack pattern analysis
./leakfinder.sh channels                   # Channel leak detection (Uber LeakProf)
```

## 🧠 **GC Leak Analysis - Distinguish Real Leaks from GC Delays**

Add **`-force-gc`** to any command to verify if detected leaks are real or just waiting for garbage collection:

```bash
# Add GC analysis to any command:
./leakfinder.sh check -force-gc              # Quick check + GC verification
./leakfinder.sh analyze -force-gc            # Detailed analysis + GC verification  
./leakfinder.sh compare -force-gc            # Before/after + GC verification
./leakfinder.sh monitor -force-gc            # Real-time monitoring + GC verification

# Combine with focus options:
./leakfinder.sh check -force-gc -memory-only     # Memory check + GC test
./leakfinder.sh analyze -force-gc -goroutines-only # Goroutine analysis + GC test

# Custom GC parameters:
./leakfinder.sh -gc-cycles=3 -gc-wait=60s check -force-gc    # 3 GC cycles, wait 60s
./leakfinder.sh -gc-threshold=70 analyze -force-gc           # 70% effectiveness threshold
```

### **How GC Analysis Works:**
1. **📊 Initial measurement** - Takes baseline readings
2. **🧹 Force GC cycles** - Triggers immediate garbage collection (default: 2 cycles)
3. **⏳ Wait for natural GC** - Allows background cleanup to complete (default: 30s)
4. **📊 Final measurement** - Compares before/after to determine leak confidence

### **GC Analysis Results:**
- **🟢 GC CLEANUP DELAY** (≥80% freed) - Not a real leak, just waiting for GC
- **🟡 PARTIAL LEAK** (≥50% freed) - Some cleanup occurred, investigate further
- **🟠 LIKELY LEAK** (≥20% freed) - Minimal GC cleanup, probably a real leak
- **🔴 CONFIRMED LEAK** (<20% freed) - GC had no effect, definitely a leak

### Option 2: Direct Go Usage
```bash
# Build once, run multiple times (clean paths)
go build -o leakfinder leakfinder.go

# Then use the built binary with consistent flags
./leakfinder check
./leakfinder check -goroutines-only
./leakfinder -verbose analyze -memory-only
./leakfinder monitor -goroutines-only
./leakfinder compare -memory-only
./leakfinder patterns

# Add GC analysis to any command:
./leakfinder check -force-gc
./leakfinder analyze -force-gc -memory-only
./leakfinder compare -force-gc -goroutines-only
./leakfinder -gc-cycles=3 -gc-wait=60s check -force-gc

# Or run directly (shows temp paths in help)
go run leakfinder.go check
go run leakfinder.go -force-gc analyze -memory-only
go run leakfinder.go -goroutines-only monitor
```

```

### Option 2: Direct Go Usage
Choose your preferred method:

#### A) Build First (Clean Paths)
```bash
# Build once
go build -o leak-detector leak_detection_toolkit.go

# Use built binary (clean help output)
./leak-detector check
./leak-detector -verbose analyze
./leak-detector patterns
```

#### B) Run Directly (Temp Paths)
```bash
# Run directly (shows temp paths in help messages)
go run leak_detection_toolkit.go check
go run leak_detection_toolkit.go -verbose -goroutine-critical=1000 check
go run leak_detection_toolkit.go -monitor-duration=10m monitor

# Pattern analysis
go run leak_detection_toolkit.go -leakprof-threshold=10 patterns
go run leak_detection_toolkit.go channels

# Filtered analysis (with environment variables)
FILTER_FUNC=myFunction go run leak_detection_toolkit.go filter
```

### Which Option to Choose?

- **Shell Script** (`./leak_detector.sh`) - Best for most users
  - ✅ Clean output and user-friendly messages
  - ✅ Automatic pprof connectivity checks
  - ✅ Enhanced error handling
  
- **Build First** (`go build` then `./leak-detector`) - Best for repeated use
  - ✅ Clean help messages without temp paths
  - ✅ Faster execution (no compilation each time)
  - ✅ Single binary deployment
  
- **Direct Go Run** (`go run`) - Best for quick testing
  - ✅ No build step required
  - ⚠️ Shows temp paths in help messages
  - ⚠️ Compiles each time (slower)

## 🔧 Memory Profile Analysis

The toolkit saves memory profiles that you can analyze with Go's pprof tool:

```bash
# After running memory analysis
go tool pprof reports/memory_profile_TIMESTAMP.pprof

# Common pprof commands:
(pprof) top          # Show top memory consumers
(pprof) top -cum     # Show cumulative allocations
(pprof) list main    # Show line-by-line allocations
(pprof) web          # Generate web visualization
(pprof) png          # Generate PNG graph
(pprof) traces       # Show allocation traces
```

## 🚨 Common Leak Patterns Detected

The toolkit identifies these suspicious patterns:

### Goroutine Patterns
- **Infinite loops**: `for {`, `for;;`, `select {`
- **Blocking operations**: `chan`, `<-`, `sync.WaitGroup`
- **Network hangs**: `net.Dial`, `http.Client`, `io.Copy`
- **Retry loops**: `retry`, `Retry`, `backoff`, `attempt`
- **Database hangs**: `sql.DB`, `Query`, `Exec`

### Memory Patterns  
- **Gradual growth**: Continuous memory increase
- **Cliff drops**: Sudden memory decreases (crashes)
- **High object counts**: Excessive heap objects
- **Poor GC efficiency**: High allocation rates

## ✅ What Success Looks Like

- **Configurable baselines**: Thresholds match your application
- **Stable patterns**: Memory and goroutines return to baseline
- **Clean analysis**: No suspicious patterns detected
- **Good health scores**: Consistently above 80
- **Minimal differences**: Before/after comparisons show small changes
- **No LeakProf alerts**: Production algorithms find no persistent channel leaks
- **GC Analysis confirms**: Detected issues are real leaks, not GC delays

### Alert Thresholds
```bash
# Custom production thresholds
./leak_detector.sh \
  -goroutine-critical=2000 \
  -memory-critical=4000 \
  -verbose \
  check
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Connection refused**: Ensure pprof is enabled and accessible
- **High baselines**: Adjust thresholds with `-goroutine-critical` flags
- **No reports saved**: Check `-reports-dir` permissions
- **Timeout errors**: Increase `-timeout` value

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose output for debugging
./leak_detector.sh -verbose -timeout=60s check
```
